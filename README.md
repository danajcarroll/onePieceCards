# One Piece Character Cards

### Project Description
I love the anime One Piece, and I also love working with JavaScript. I decided to combine the two by making a small app that goes through the main characters and their bios!

### Technologies Used
This project was made with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. I wanted to do as much things dynamically using JavaScript. DOM Manipulation, for loops, and eventListeners were some of the main things I used.

### Challenges
Manipulating the DOM proved to be tricky sometimes, and I learnt when using a class or ID would be more beneficial. Another more specific challenge would be changing CSS elements along with active classes. Stepping away and thinking about the problem I was facing with a pen and paper proved to be super helpful. There were also times where I could see myself repeating myself. You might notice there are some parts that aren't very DRY! I knew that with practice I'll be able to create projects that are more and more efficient, so I chose to finish the project fully before focusing too much on optimization.
